Being a foodie, I’ve been thinking about this question for a while.

My initial guess as to why hot food tastes better is that the heat opens up pores on the tongue, increasing the surface area and enhancing the taste. But if that’s the case, why do ice creams or cold desserts taste so good?

Maybe it has nothing to do with temperature at all.

If not temperature, then perhaps it's a combination of other sensory responses, like smell. While ice creams do have aromas coming from flavoring substances even when cold, it’s probably not just the smell. It could be a combination of both smell and taste.

What if your mind is tricking you into believing certain foods taste the way you imagine them, even before they enter your mouth?
